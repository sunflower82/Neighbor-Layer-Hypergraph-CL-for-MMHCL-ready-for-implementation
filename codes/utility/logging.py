"""
logging.py — Dual-Destination Logger
======================================

Provides a simple Logger class that writes timestamped messages to:
  1. The console (stdout).
  2. A per-experiment log file (in the run-specific directory).
  3. Optionally, a second log file in a shared aggregation directory
     (useful for comparing results across ablation experiments).

File structure created by the logger:
    ../<dataset>/<path_name>/<path_name>.txt     — per-run detailed log
    ../<dataset>/MM/<path_name>.txt              — copy of the same log
    ../<dataset>/MM/sum_<ablation>.txt           — one-line summaries
